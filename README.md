# .NET MVC Web app, Azure SQL
## Introduction

Contoso University is a sample application that demonstrates how to use Entity Framework Core in an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app. This app can be deployed to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform that allows you to build, deploy, and scale web apps.

This sample application is structured in a way to be compatible with [Azure Developer CLI (azd) ](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/) which are currently in preview.

> Refer to the [App Templates](https://github.com/microsoft/App-Templates) repo Readme for more samples that are compatible with [`azd`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/).

## Tech stack:

- Azure
- Azure-sql-db
- .NET MVC Web
- Github Actions
- App Insights
- Log Analytics
- Bicep
- Terraform (coming soon) 

## Prerequisites
- Local shell with Azure CLI installed or [Azure Cloud Shell](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#cloudshell/)
- Azure Subscription, on which you are able to create resources and assign permissions
  - View your subscription using ```az account show``` 
  - If you don't have an account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).  
  

Use your favorite terminal to run the az cli commands

## Getting Started
### Fork the repository

Fork the repository by clicking the 'Fork' button on the top right of the page.
This creates a local copy of the repository for you to work in. 

### Create Resource Group
Run the below az cli command to create a resource group named "rg-ContosoUniversityDemo". Change resourcegroup and location variable as required. If you are changing the resourcegroupname, you must update the resourcegroup name under ContosoUniversity - Infra.yml as well after the az group command is run.

```
$resourceGroup='rg-ContosoUniversityDemo'
$location='eastus'
az login
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location $location
```

 Navigate to [ContosoUniversity - Infra.yml](https://github.com/microsoft/csu-digiapps-p-azure-sql-db-dotnet/blob/main/.github/workflows/ContosoUniversity%20-%20Infra.yml) and modify the default AZ_RG_NAME as required:
      
  ```yaml
   AZ_RG_NAME: 'rg-ContosoUniversityDemo'
  ```

View your {subscription-id}

```
az account show
```

### Azure Configuration for GitHub  

The newly created GitHub repo uses GitHub Actions to deploy Azure resources and application code automatically. Your subscription is accessed using an Azure Service Principal. This is an identity created for use by applications, hosted services, and automated tools to access Azure resources. The following steps show how to [set up GitHub Actions to deploy Azure applications](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/assets/create-secrets-for-GitHub-workflows.md)

Create an [Azure Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli) with **contributor** permissions on the subscription. The subscription-level permission is needed because the deployment includes creation of the resource group itself.
 * Run the following [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) command, either locally on your command line or on the Cloud Shell. 
   Replace {app-name} {subscription-id} with the id of the subscription in GUID format.
    ```bash  
       az ad sp create-for-rbac --name {app-name} --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/rg-ContosoUniversityDemo --sdk-auth     
      ```
 * The command should output a JSON object similar to this:
 ```
      {
        "clientId": "<GUID>",
        "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
        "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
        "tenantId": "<GUID>",
        "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "<URL>",
        "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "galleryEndpointUrl": "<URL>",
        "managementEndpointUrl": "<URL>"
      }
   ```
 * Store the output JSON as the value of a GitHub Actions secret named 'AZURE_CREDENTIALS'
   + Under your repository name, click Settings. 
   + In the "Security" section of the sidebar, select Secrets. 
   + At the top of the page, click New repository secret
   + Provide the secret name as AZURE_CREDENTIALS
   + Add the output JSON as secret value
   
### Azure Resource Prefix

Create AZURE_APP_NAME as New Repository Secret and provide a secret value. This will be used as the prefix for webapp and web api names.

### Azure SQL Configuration

AAD is used to access Azure SQL. 

 - Add ```AZ_SQL_AAD_ADMIN_NAME``` as a Repository Secret and provide the name you gave your Github Actions service principal
 - Assign AAD Read permissions to the Service Principal. See this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-azure-ad-user-assigned-managed-identity?view=azuresql) for more details.
 > Assigning AAD users in SQL Database requires an AAD lookup. This is why AAD permissions are required against the Service Principal running the deployment. AAD permissions can take a few minutes to propagate.

### GitHub Workflow 
Run the GitHub Action workflow "ContosoUniversity-Infra"
* If workflows are enabled for this repository it should run automatically. To enable the workflow run automatically, Go to Actions and enable the workflow if needed.
* Workflow can be manually run 
     + Under your repository name, click Actions .
     + In the left sidebar, click the workflow "ContosoUniversity-Infra".
     + Above the list of workflow runs, select Run workflow .
     + Use the Branch dropdown to select the workflow's main branch, Click Run workflow .

After deployment, below resources will be created

## Deploy Application

1. Create new secret for connection string - AZURE_CONTOSO_CONN_STRING. For secret value, copy the connection string by navigating to Azure SqlServer DB via portal, change {your_password} with AZURE_PASSWORD secret value.

2. Create new secret for Application Insights - AZURE_CONTOSO_APP_INSIGHTS.  For secret value, copy the connection string by navigating to Azure Application Insights resource overview via portal.

3. Run the GitHub Actions workflow "ContosoUniversity"
* If workflows are enabled for this repository it should run automatically. To enable the workflow run automatically, Go to Actions and enable the workflow if needed.
* Workflow can be manually run 
     + Under your repository name, click Actions .
     + In the left sidebar, click the workflow "ContosoUniversity".
     + Above the list of workflow runs, select Run workflow .
     + Use the Branch dropdown to select the workflow's main branch, Click Run workflow .

## Contoso University website

Once successfully deployed, the application is accessible through the webapp appservice endpoint hostname ending in -app.azurewebsites.net. Under your resource group, you can look at the "App Service" resource with "-app" suffixed to its name through the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

## Clean up resources
When you are done, you can delete all the Azure resources created with this template by running the following command:

```
resourceGroup=rg-ContosoUniversityDemo
az group delete --name $resourceGroup
```
